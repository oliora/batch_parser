Batch Parser
============

MS batch file format parser written with Boost.Spirit. Created mainly as side effect of Boost.Spirit education.
Tool parses a batch file and extracts a list of near all present commands and their arguments.
The only useful purpose of this tool is to detect whether some file is a batch file :).

**WIP!!!**
